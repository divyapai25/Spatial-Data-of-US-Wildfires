# Spatial-Data-of-US-Wildfires

The original dataset is acquired from Kaggle. It contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This project helped me to perform and learn the following:-

1. Cleaned the original bad and missing data using Excel, designed a data model in third normalization form
2. Followed good database design principles and created a physical database in MySQL
3. Migrated the original data with 1.88 million records from SQLite to MySQL using R and ran six SQL queries
4. Prepared a MongoDB database and loaded data into it in order to perform six MongoDB queries
5. Identified forests with high risk of wildfires, its causes and helped firms decide which state will receive fund for removing debris by using appropriate SQL queries
